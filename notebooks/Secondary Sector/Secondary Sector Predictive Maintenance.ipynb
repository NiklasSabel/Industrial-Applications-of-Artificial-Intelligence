    "Industrial companies rely heavily on the machines that operate within their assembly lines. Even the slighest error that would cause the line to be stopped will result in losses of serveral hundred to thousands of euros. In 2015, insiders calculated that one minute of downtime costs Daimler, BMW and AUDI between €1000 and €6000 [(src)](https://www.dvz.de/rubriken/logistik/it-in-der-logistik/detail/news/geruestet-fuer-den-blackout.html#:~:text=Denn%20eine%20Minute%20Bandstillstand%20bei,zwischen%201000%20und%206000%20EUR.). Due to rising competition in a global economy, predictive maintenance becomes a crucial task to no lose money and time in operations, because a company is able to prevent breakdowns with early countermeasures. The challenge arises for the company to prevent components from being replaced too early in the lifecycle and still ensuring reliability. Machine Learning can help in this task. By making use of data from the machines itself and sensors in the surrounding, companies are able to plan ahead and schedule actions to keep their assembly line healthy. One possible way to do this, is modelling the failure/non-failure of a machine as a binary classification. In the following we want to explore how to preprocess a related dataset and how models are able to support companies in recognizing a failure or not."
