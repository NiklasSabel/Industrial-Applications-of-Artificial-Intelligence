    "Credit decisions, personal potential evaluation or support in judgements. Machine Learning algorithms are touching more and more areas of people's personal lives. However, this is not always benefitial. A sensation has been caused in 2016 by the publication of ProPublica about the software COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) that should help in discovering the underlying risk of a criminal becoming a recidivist [[1]](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). The authors found out that the algorithm is highly biased towards black people such that \"black defendants are far more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher risk of recidivism\" [[2]](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm). This impressively illustrates that if developers and designers are not careful, human bias is picked up by algorithms leading to highly unfair results. Therefore, one has to be especially cautious involving personal sensitive data, for example sex, political attitude or religious affiliation. In the following notebook, we explore the influence of sensitive information in the case of income prediction and investigate how sensitive data can influence the decision."

On top of that, it is also noticeable that the majority of people in the study work in the private sector.\n",
    "Most of people have 9 years of school education, which is equivalent to a high school graduation. Furthermore, it is evident that wh have far more people pursuing higher education than stopping before nine years. Regarding relationship and marital-status, it seems that most people are married or have never-married. We also see that relationship and marital-status might be somehow redundant, because there is a clear overlap. Therefore, we investigate the correlations between all the features in the course of the work."

For the other groups it seems that the main percentage of people having nine years of education, with some exceptions, e.g., Whites having a clear edge in percentage in >=13 years of education over the other groups outside Asian-American. Based on the educational-data, we can see that there might be problematic cases of having different distributions, especially for the races.

    "We can clearly see that the distribution is nearly the same for all our sets. As we generated the train-test-validation split in the previous step, we now want to scale the data as described earlier. This is for the reason, that different scales might actually distort our algorithm a lot due to big differences in the scales. For scaling, we use the StandardScaler from the sklearn package. It should be noted that we only fit the scaler on our training data and use only the transformation on the validation and testing part, because we do not want to include information about validation and test that could already help the algorithm (data leakage)."

We can clearly see that for Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Asian-Pac-Islander and Black persons themodel is more likely to predict a higher income although that is not the case, while for Other and White people, it is more likely to predict less income. This shows that there is some small bias against those two groups. Unfortunately, we do not know, which people fall under the Other category. However, we see that the sample is not really big for most groups. So, this could be by chance as well and if we would have more samples, it would balance out (law of large numbers) ."

However, as the amount of data is that small for some groups, we cannot really distinguish that this happens by chance or if there is bias inside the model. But it seems that discarding the race feature benefits the model and since it is a highly critical feature, it seems appropriate to do that."

    "In comparison, to our earlier results for gender, we can clearly see that we have a lot of more false negatives for women such that we predict the lower income class instead of the higher income class. This happens, because we excluded all high income women from the training set. Therefore, the model could not learn that women can have a high income. This shows that bias cannot only be introduced by features itself, but by a biased train-test split as well."

    "Unfortunately, we can not give a final answer about the question if bias is introduced or not based on the features itself, although there are signs that it is better to discard the race feature. However, how bias can be introduced by a bad train-test-split is quite clear and has to be taken into account. In the remaining work, we focus on improving the model by different feature selection methods and hyperparameter optimization. Thereby, we first try three other models, namelyLogistic Regression, XGBoost and RF to compare the results to our decision tree and see if they are already far better. As baselines, we gonna implement a random rate classifier that uses prior knowledge of class assignments in predicting the lass and the prior used decision tree."
