    "Credit decisions, personal potential evaluation or support in judgements. Machine Learning algorithms are touching more and more areas of people's personal lives. However, this is not always benefitial. A sensation has been caused in 2016 by the publication of ProPublica about the software COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) that should help in discovering the underlying risk of a criminal becoming a recidivist [[1]](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). The authors found out that the algorithm is highly biased towards black people such that \"black defendants are far more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher risk of recidivism\" [[2]](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm). This impressively illustrates that if developers and designers are not careful, human bias is picked up by algorithms leading to highly unfair results. Therefore, one has to be especially cautious involving personal sensitive data, for example sex, political attitude or religious affiliation. In the following notebook, we explore the influence of sensitive information in the case of income prediction and investigate how sensitive data can influence the decision."

The task is modelled as a binary classification to predicct if an individual's income excceds $50,000 based on data from the US Census Bureau. We want to explore if sensitive information does have an influence on the result and compare it to the case, when some information are discarded.\n",

As we generated the train-test-validation split in the previous step, we now want to scale the data as described earlier. This is for the reason, that different scales might actually distort our algorithm a lot due to big differences in the scales. For scaling, we use the StandardScaler from the sklearn package. It should be noted that we only fit the scaler on our training data and use only the transformation on the validation and testing part, because we do not want to include information about validation and test that could already help the algorithm (data leakage)."
