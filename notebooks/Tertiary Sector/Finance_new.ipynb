    "Credit decisions, personal potential evaluation or support in judgements. Machine Learning algorithms are touching more and more areas of people's personal lives. However, this is not always benefitial. A sensation has been caused in 2016 by the publication of ProPublica about the software COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) that should help in discovering the underlying risk of a criminal becoming a recidivist [[1]](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). The authors found out that the algorithm is highly biased towards black people such that \"black defendants are far more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher risk of recidivism\" [[2]](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm). This impressively illustrates that if developers and designers are not careful, human bias is picked up by algorithms leading to highly unfair results. Therefore, one has to be especially cautious involving personal sensitive data, for example sex, political attitude or religious affiliation. In the following notebook, we explore the influence of sensitive information in the case of income prediction and investigate how sensitive data can influence the decision."

It was published by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems of the University of California and the original dataset can be found under the following [link](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/adult/desc.html). The task is modelled as a binary classification to predict if an individual's income excceds $50,000 based on data from the US Census Bureau. We want to explore if sensitive information does have an influence on the result and compare it to the case, when some features are discarded.\n",

On top of that, it is also noticeable that the majority of people in the study work in the private sector.\n",
    "Most of people have 9 years of school education, which is equivalent to a high school graduation. Furthermore, it is evident that we have far more people pursuing higher education than stopping before nine years. Regarding relationship and marital-status, it seems that most people are either married or have never-married. We also see that relationship and marital-status might be somehow redundant, because there is a clear overlap. Therefore, we investigate the correlations between all the features in the course of the work."

    "We can see that there is a small tendency for women to have a higher percentage share completing higher education (e.g., a college: 10-12 years). However, the tendency shifts again, when it comes to doctoral degress (>12 years), where the share of man is higher again in percentage.\n",
    "Based on the race there is a clear tendency that Asian-American pursue higher degrees, even doctoral dignities. For the other groups it seems that the main percentage of people having nine years of education, with some exceptions, e.g., Whites having a clear edge in percentage in >=13 years of education over the other groups outside Asian-American. Based on the educational-data, we can see that there might be problematic cases of having different distributions, especially for the races. In contrast, we have already seen that women earn less than men, which cannot be based on the number of years of training."

This is for the reason, that different scales might actually distort our algorithm a lot due to big differences in the scales. For scaling, we use the StandardScaler from the sklearn package. It should be noted that we only fit the scaler on our training data and use only the transformation on the validation and testing part, because we do not want to include information about validation and test that could already help the algorithm (data leakage)."

We can clearly see that for Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Asian-Pac-Islander and Black persons the model is more likely to predict a higher income although that is not the case, while for Other and White people, it is more likely to predict less income. This shows that there is some small bias against those two groups. Unfortunately, we do not know, which people fall under the Other category. However, we see that the sample is not really big for most groups. So, these deviations could be by chance as well and if we would have more samples, it would balance out (law of large numbers) ."

However, as the amount of data is that small for some groups, we cannot really distinguish that this happens by chance or if there is bias inside the model. But it seems that discarding the race feature benefits the model performance overall and since it is a highly critical feature, it seems appropriate to do that."

    "In comparison, to our earlier results for gender, we can clearly see that we have a lot of more false negatives for women such that we predict the lower income class instead of the higher income class. This happens, because we excluded all high income women from the training set. Therefore, the model could not learn that women can have a high income. This shows that bias cannot only be introduced by features itself, but by a biased train-test split as well."

    "Unfortunately, we can not give a final answer about the question if bias is introduced or not based on the features itself, although there are signs that it is better to discard the race feature. However, how bias can be introduced by a bad train-test-split is quite obvious and has to be taken into account. In the remaining work, we focus on improving the model by different feature selection methods and hyperparameter optimization. Thereby, we first try three other models, namely Logistic Regression, XGBoost and Random Forest to compare the results to our decision tree and see if they are already better. As baselines, we gonna implement a random rate classifier that uses prior knowledge of class assignments in predicting the class and the prior used decision tree."

    "The most important feature by far, outshining all other features, is the marital status with the value Married-civ-spouse that has the most influence on the model. The value corresponds to a person that is married and their partner is not part of the US armed forces in any way. Unfortunately, as we can see below it does not seem that there is a clear tendency towards one of the income classes for this feature and it is not directly clear why its influence is that high. Other more important features are better explainable, e.g., the amount of training years: the more training years one has the more probable is a high income. It is also explainable why capital gain and capital loss have a high influence, because if you have an higher income, it is more likely that you invest money, as you do not necessary need all money for living expenses. This leads to capital gains or losses over time. One top of this being an executive as occupation does have a high impact as well, which makes sense, because most often managers earn more than \"normal\" employees."

On top of that, we see that those false negatives (high income - low prediction) have overall nearly no capital-gains or capital-losses. This can also be a reason why they are classified as low income, because high values are an indicator for higher income and wealth, e.g., due to invested capital."

Unfortunately, there is no further outlying behaviour in this sample, expect for the fact that one person only works 9 hours per week, a clear reason for the lower prediction."

    "- Checking if removing correlated features can improve the results.\n",
    "- Generate features for possible improvement of models (for example brute force linear combinations of features via featuretools package or brainstorming for possible feature combinations).\n",
